### Status of requests from Product Owner (Iteration 1)
1) Add New Note - functional
2) Display All Notes - functional
3) Filter Notes FE Prototype (less performant) - functional
4) Filter Notes on API (more performant) - draft lambda (see files)

### Performance Improvements in Development (Iteration 2)
* implement Continuous Integration - complete
* re-style application - complete
* increase test coverage to 95%+ - complete
* filter by date newest to oldest - in development
* filter Notes at API layer instead of within application - in development

#### How to Use
To run a copy of Noteful locally:
1. Clone this repo
2. On command line, first: `bundle install`
3. Then `rake db:create` (Noteful doesn't use a local database, but this will remove the db error)
4. Run test suite: `rspec`
5. To run the app locally: `rails s`, then navigate in browser to `localhost:3000`

#### Rails API service model
